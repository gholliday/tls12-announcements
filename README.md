| Microsoft | [Whitepaper - Solving the TLS 1.0 Problem](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55266) | The goal of this document is to provide recommendations which can help remove technical blockers to disabling TLS 1.0 while at the same time increasing visibility into the impact of this change to your own customers.  |
| Microsoft | [New IIS functionality to help identify weak TLS usage ](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2017/09/07/new-iis-functionality-to-help-identify-weak-tls-usage/) | Server variables surfaced so that they can be added to IIS logs: CRYPT_PROTOCOL, CRYPT_CIPHER_ALG_ID, CRYPT_HASH_ALG_ID, CRYPT_KEYEXCHANGE_ALG_ID |
| Microsoft | [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with the .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls) | - Target .NET Framework 4.7 or later versions on your apps. Target .NET Framework 4.7.1 or later versions on your WCF apps.<br>- Do not specify the TLS version. Configure your code to let the OS decide on the TLS version.<br>- Perform a thorough code audit to verify you're not specifying a TLS or SSL version. |
| Microsoft | [PowerShell]() | Add this to your profile or scripts to enable support for TLS 1.2 protocol: `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12` |
| Microsoft | [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases) | - TLS 1.2 support added in [v1.14.0](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/releases/tag/v1.14.0). <br>- Included in Git for Windows [v2.16.0.windows.2](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.16.0.windows.2) |
| Microsoft | [Visual Studio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/201457/unable-to-connect-to-github-due-to-tls-12-only-cha.html) | Upgrade to the latest release of Visual Studio 2017. The latest version of Visual Studio 2017 includes the necessary updates to components that support connecting to servers using TLS 1.2. |
| Microsoft | [TLS 1.2 support for Microsoft SQL Server](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3135244/tls-1-2-support-for-microsoft-sql-server) | This article provides information about the updates that Microsoft is releasing to enable TLS 1.2 support for SQL Server 2017 on Windows, SQL Server 2016, SQL Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 R2, SQL Server 2012, and SQL Server 2014. This article also lists supported client providers. |
| Microsoft | [Enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 support in SharePoint Server 2016](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/SharePoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-support-in-sharepoint-server-2016) | This article describes how to enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol versions 1.1 and 1.2 in a SharePoint Server 2016 environment.

| Microsoft | [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-prerequisites) | Azure AD Connect (version 1.1.614.0 and after) by default uses TLS 1.2 for encrypting communication between the sync engine and Azure AD. If TLS 1.2 isn't available on the underlying operating system, Azure AD Connect incrementally falls back to older protocols (TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0). |
| Xamarin | [Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac and System.Net.WebRequest](https://blog.xamarin.com/securing-network-traffic-with-tls-1-2/) | In most cases, Xamarin apps should use either the .NET System.Net.Http.HttpClient class or the System.Net.WebRequest class for network calls. The HttpClient class uses a instance of HttpMessageHandler to process the results of a network call. Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS both provide implementations of the HttpMessageHandler API that will determine what version of TLS the app will use.
